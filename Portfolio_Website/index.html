                <p class="info">
                    As a evening stocker, my job was to stock shelves from frieght boxes and customer return carts.
                    Customer service was also a big part of my job, and I assisted customers in their plumbing needs 
                    and placed online orders.

                <h4 class="position">Position: Junior Developer Intern</h4>
                <p class="info">
                    My primary project was to explore the capabilities of a RTOS made using different libaries and languages.
                    This was done using a Nucleo H7 as a testing device, and a Nucleo L4 as the device being tested. The testing device was made 
                    in C with FreeRTOS, and the L4 was made in bare metal C with just HAL, C with FreeRTOS, and RUST with RTIC. My job was to compare 
                    the jitter, bandwidth, and latency of the three different programs on the L4. Load was applied using CRC calulations, GPIO responses, I2C, and UART, 
                    and was all interrupt-driven.<br><br>
                    In this internship I became familiar with interrupt-driven programming, C, Rust, FreeRTOS, RTIC, Embassy, I2C, UART, SPI, ADC, and hardware timers.

            <h3 class="keyboard-title">Custom Keyboard</h3>
            <div class="info">
                I built a custom one-handed keyboard without the use of a PCB board, wiring a matrix using diodes.
                I used an ESP32 and its bluetooth capabilities to make the communication wireless, although 
                there is currently no battery so it still needs wired power.
                The base and baseplate were designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed, and the code was programmed using PlatformIO with C++.
            </div>
            <h3 class="ai-title">Simple Neural Network</h3>
            <div class="info">
                I built a program that could tell the difference between a picture of a tomato and an apple with a neural network.
                This was achieved in Python and using the PyTorch libary. The program converted images to 100x100 pixels and then trained
                the neural network using a CNN. A seperate batch of files was used for testing, and the model achieved 97% accuracy.

            <h3 class="business-website">Website for Business</h3>
            <div class="info">
                I am currently in the process of creating a website for a business from my home town. 
                This business is the Coleman Agency Farm Bureau location in Harvey, Michigan.
                The goal of this website is to make a web page that is more interactive with users and more customized with what the business wants.
                This includes a different layout, and a way for customers to easily send information through the website.
